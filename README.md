# Emotion-Recognition-Fuzzy-Logic

A Fuzzy Logic Solution for detecting emotions via monitoring eye behavior.

This project uses MATLAB Simulinkâ€™s Fuzzy Logic Controller with Mamdani fuzzy inference system to implement predetermined eye behavior logic. 

The rule set of eye behavior can be found in the Excel file.
The project report outlines the methodology and reasoning behind this implementation.
The .fis can be opened using Matlab Simulink to observe the implementation.
